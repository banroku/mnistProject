saved "mymnist.m", shuffled train, cv, test datasets. 
saved "reset.m", to reset the environment. 
saved "featureScaling.m" to scale Xtrain, cv ,test datasets. 
saved "orderShuffling.m" to shuffle traing data for stocastic decent.
saved "randomInitTheta.m" to randomly initialize theta.

saved "checkRC.m" to check if row/column of X be inversed. 
saved "matrixizeY.m" to generate 0/1 matrix of Y. 
saved "setEnvironment.m"  (and remove "learningMNIST.m"). 
saved "costLogisticReg.m" and fill function J

saved "costLogisticReg.m"
saved "trainByLogisticReg.m"
however, fmincg didnot work. error on line 81 of fmincg.m

next: correct error. might be matrix size of theta having problem?

corrected "trainByLoisticReg.m" by reshape theta matrix to vector
saved "predict.m"
saved "calculateAccuracy.m"

finally got Accuracy of training set!! 
Unfortunately it was deadly small (0.00132), 
indicating something wrong in my programming.

next: implement gradient checking to verify my cost function
      (hint: accuracy didn't change even if changing lambda)

= 180223 Fri 04:40-06:10	01:30	total 6:50
correct "featureScaling.m" to simple type
implimented gradient checking in "costLogisticReg.m", confirmed gradient is correct

completed logisticRegression! 
Score: Itr:100, J_train:0.63, Acc_train: 0.92, (with lambda=0). 

next check J_cv, Acc_cv

= 180226 Mon 04:30-06:30	02:00	total 8:50
updated github/mnistProject
calculate Jcv at various lambda: best lambda was 0-10
completed logistic regression !!

next: visulalization,

completed NN!

next: visulaization, stochastic decent, SVM

= 180302 Fri 04:30-05:30	01:00	total 13:50
tried 100 nodes. 

add generateTheta.m with K as vector
next: vectorize K1, K2 to K in all program to adopt generalized NN architechture
then next: stochastic decent, SVM

= 180305 Mon 03:30-06:30	03:00	total 16:50
implimented generlized NN!

next: cost doesn't match in learning and J calculation. 
next: gradient checking to confirm generalization, then stochastic decent, then SVM

= 180307 Wed 04:30-06:30	0:40	total 17:30
implimented gradient checking in generalized NN -> ok
implimented regularized NN!

next: stochastic decent

= 180308 Thu 06:00-06:30	0:30	total 17:30
fix github issue, 

next: stochastic decent <- move LogisticReg and NN to other folder (too crowded.)

= 180309 Fri 05:30-06:30	1:00	total 18:30
complete stochastic decent! ULTRA FAST! only an epoch needed!
but to adjust lambda. 

next: J and cost at fminic was not equal, need investigation.
