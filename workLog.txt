save "mymnist.m" 
next: make Xcv and Ycv

= 180218 Sun 05:10-06:40	01:30	total 1:50
saved "mymnist.m", shuffled train, cv, test datasets. 
saved "reset.m", to reset the environment. 
saved "featureScaling.m" to scale Xtrain, cv ,test datasets. 
saved "orderShuffling.m" to shuffle traing data for stocastic decent.
saved "randomInitTheta.m" to randomly initialize theta.

= 180220 Tue 04:00-6:30		02:30
saved "checkRC.m" to check if row/column of X be inversed. 
saved "matrixizeY.m" to generate 0/1 matrix of Y. 
saved "setEnvironment.m"  (and remove "learningMNIST.m"). 
saved "costLogisticReg.m" and fill function J 

next: fill function grad
      gradient checking, (plot)

= 180221 Wed 04:30-06:00	01:30	total 3:20
saved "costLogisticReg.m"
saved "trainByLogisticReg.m"
however, fmincg didnot work. error on line 81 of fmincg.m

next: correct error. might be matrix size of theta having problem? 


= 180222 Thu 04:00-06:00	02:00 	total 5:20 
corrected "trainByLoisticReg.m" by reshape theta matrix to vector
saved "predict.m"
saved "calculateAccuracy.m"

finally got Accuracy of training set!! 
Unfortunately it was deadly small (0.00132), 
indicating something wrong in my programming.

next: implement gradient checking to verify my cost function
      (hint: accuracy didn't change even if changing lambda)

= 180223 Fri 04:40-06:10	01:30	total 6:50
correct "featureScaling.m" to simple type
implimented gradient checking in "costLogisticReg.m", confirmed gradient is correct

completed logisticRegression! 
Score: Itr:100, J_train:0.63, Acc_train: 0.92, (with lambda=0). 

next check J_cv, Acc_cv

= 180225 Sun 13:00-15:00
make environment of git 	no count

= 180226 Mon 04:30-06:30	02:00	total 8:50
updated github/mnistProject
calculate Jcv at various lambda: best lambda was 0-10
completed logistic regression !!

next: visulalization, 
next: neural network implimentation
